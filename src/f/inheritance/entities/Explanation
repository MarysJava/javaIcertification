Inheritance relationship:

Employee is the superclass
MyAbstractClass extends Employee
Manager, HRExecutive and IWantToBreakFreeProgrammer are subclasses of MyAbstractClass


Interfaces:

Employee implements BaseIF1
HRExecutive implements Interviewer
IWantToBreakFreeProgrammer implements Trainable 
Manager implements Trainable, Interviewer
MyAbstractClass don't implement any IF but inherit BaseIF1 from Employee because it extends Employee
All subclasses (Manager, HRExecutive and IWantToBreakFreeProgrammer) consequently inherit BaseIF1
